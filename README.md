# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
Understand the factors that make a password strong and evaluate it using online password strength checking tools.

## Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com/)
- Any other free password strength checker

## Steps Performed
1. Created multiple passwords with varying complexity (simple, medium, strong).
2. Included variations:
   - Uppercase and lowercase letters
   - Numbers
   - Special characters
   - Different lengths
3. Tested each password using **PasswordMeter**.
4. Noted down the strength scores and feedback from the tool.
5. Identified best practices for creating strong passwords.
6. Documented tips and insights from the evaluation.
7. Researched common password attacks:
   - Brute force
   - Dictionary attacks
8. Summarized how password complexity affects security.

## Findings
- Short or simple passwords are easily guessable.
- Including a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols significantly improves strength.
- Longer passwords (12+ characters) are more resistant to brute-force attacks.
- Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns.

## Best Practices
- Use at least 12 characters.
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Avoid personal information and dictionary words.
- Use passphrases for better memorability.

## Outcome
Gained practical knowledge on password strength, evaluation, and security best practices.
